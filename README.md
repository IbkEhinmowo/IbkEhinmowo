# ðŸ’« About Me:
### wagwan, Iâ€™m Ibk ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Computer Science student passionate about **building practical tools and backend systems** that solve real problems.  
My focus is on **AI-driven workflows, automation, and scalable backend architecture**, with projects that bridge APIs, orchestration layers, and real-world integrations.

ðŸ”¹ **What Iâ€™m working on:**  
- A **modular AI orchestration platform** with multi-channel support (Discord, Slack, CLI)  
- **RAG-based context retrieval** for smarter assistants  
- Scalable, containerized systems with observability and error recovery

ðŸ”¹ **What Iâ€™m learning:**  
- Advanced backend engineering (async Python, system design, CI/CD)  
- LLM orchestration and agentic workflows  
- Infrastructure fundamentals (Docker, deployment pipelines)

ðŸ”¹ **Fun fact:**  
I like building tools Iâ€™d actually use. Most of my projects come from automating things I do every day.
